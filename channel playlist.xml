L’occasion pour la marque française L’Oréal Paris de créer une nouvelle fois l’évènement avec son défilé « Liberté, égalité, sororité » organisé cette année sur le parvis de l&apos;Hôtel de Ville de Paris. Ce défilé très attendu réinvente l&apos;iconique devise nationale française « Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité » en y apportant une touche féminine et féministe pour célébrer l&apos;émancipation, la confiance en soi et la sororité. Loin des standards habituels, le défilé met en lumière la beauté sous toutes ses formes et célèbre l&apos;émancipation féminine à travers le maquillage et la coiffure. Pour porter ces valeurs, des icônes fidèles ont répondu présentes : Eva Longoria et Andie MacDowell vont défiler aux côtés de top modèles tels que Cindy Bruna ou encore Helen Mirren. Et cette année, celle qui fera l’évènement, c’est Charlotte Cardin qui montera sur le podium et offrira au public un concert inédit.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025095500 +0000" stop="20251025104000 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>66 minutes : grand format</title><desc>Reportages, portraits, enquêtes, 66 Minutes : grand format explore l&apos;actualité avec un reportage sur un fait divers, un phénomène de société ou un événement de l&apos;actualité internationale.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025104000 +0000" stop="20251025104500 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>66 minutes</title><desc>Reportages, portraits, enquêtes, 66 Minutes explore l&apos;actualité de la semaine avec 3 ou 4 reportages sur des faits divers, des phénomènes de société ou des événements de l&apos;actualité internationale.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025104500 +0000" stop="20251025113000 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>Le 12.45</title><desc>Retrouvez toute l&apos;actualité de la mi-journée.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025113000 +0000" stop="20251025123500 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>Cauchemar en cuisine</title><desc>Cette semaine, Philippe Etchebest se rend dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, à Sénas, où Mélanie et Mylène, des jumelles de 28 ans, ont fait appel à lui pour sauver le restaurant qu&apos;elles gèrent avec leur grande soeur Séverine.

Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur.

Then, while practicing, she has an accident and hurts her ankle.

She insists it&apos;s no biggie, but when she tries to resume practice, the normally fearless Mia finds she&apos;s now terrified of snowboarding! At the local snow lodge&apos;s Snowboard Meet, ace snowboarder Mia, trying to raise money for a new Heartlake City animal shelter, enters the fiercest race of all – the Boardercross. Then, while practicing, she has an accident and hurts her ankle. She insists it&apos;s no big deal, but once she heals and tries to resume practice, the usually fearless Mia finds she&apos;s now terrified of snowboarding! With the help of her Friends, she tries hard to overcome her fear, but her nightmarish visions of snowboard monsters and jeering snowmen have her shaking in her bed.
