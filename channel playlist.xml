When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur.

Sie lebt für ihren Job und ihre Kunden – sehr zum Leidwesen der Beziehung zu ihrem Freund Nathan. Doch ein Anruf bringt ihr Leben völlig durcheinander: Ihre Cousine Susan und deren Mann sind bei einem Autounfall ums Leben gekommen und Margaret soll der Vormund für die beiden Kinder werden. Früher waren die Cousinen beste Freundinnen, doch sie hatten jahrelang keinen Kontakt. Margaret macht sich auf den Weg in ihre alte Heimat Mountain View, die sie seit Ewigkeiten nicht mehr besucht hat. Dort trifft sie auf die beiden ihr völlig fremden Kinder, zu denen sie nur langsam Zugang findet. Eine große Hilfe ist ihre Jugendliebe Andrew, der als deren Lehrer die engste Vertrauensperson der Kinder ist. Trotzdem fühlt Margaret sich überfordert und muss sich nicht nur entscheiden, ob sie lieber den einfachen Weg zurück in ihr altes Leben wählt oder den letzten Willen ihrer Cousine erfüllen möchte, sondern auch für wen ihr Herz schlägt.</desc></programme><programme start="20251006195000 +0000" stop="20251006214600 +0000" channel="ATBA3300021BW"><title>Tag X</title><desc>Die alleinerziehende und verwitwete Tanja (Carina Diesing) wird durch die Entführung ihrer Tochter Lilly (Jolie Sarah Werner) jäh aus ihrem schwierigen Alltag gerissen, nur um einem schrecklichen Familiengeheimnis auf die Spur zu kommen... - Spannender Entführungs-Thriller um Geheimnisse, die besser im Dunkeln verblieben wären.

Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV…maybe they can “mod” that for their own, “knightly” use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling…in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE! This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters. Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he&apos;s safe from the Knights&apos; reach. We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book. In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters. Lance thinks he should be the leader because he&apos;s a snot. “</desc></programme><programme start="20251006191600 +0000" stop="20251006193900 +0000" channel="USBA2300001S8"><title>The Warrior Within</title><desc>Cragger tricks Laval into withholding CHI from the Crocodile tribe.
