One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent&apos;s guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one.

Le commissaire Faureins prend l&apos;affaire en main, et trouve rapidement son coupable idéal : Colette Chevreau, la femme du photographe, à qui la rumeur attribue plusieurs amants. Colette a pourtant un alibi : au moment du crime, elle était à Arras, où elle participait à un avortement clandestin. Prisonnière de ce terrible secret, elle choisit de garder le silence. La presse la présente aussitôt comme une créature diabolique, sans égards pour ses enfants. Mais Anne-Marie Leroux, la juge d&apos;instruction chargée de l&apos;affaire, soupçonne le commissaire d&apos;avoir bâclé son enquête.
