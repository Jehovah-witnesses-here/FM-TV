Eventually finding refuge in a local tavern, he is immediately attracted to the sordid glamour of the drinking classes and the gritty world that they inhabit. He also finds himself becoming infatuated with the tavern&apos;s landlady, which will inadvertently lead to him being drawn into a plot to kill her abusive husband. Directed by Robert Hamer (Kind Hearts and Coronets, School For Scoundrels), Pink String and Sealing Wax stars Googie Withers (The Lady Vanishes), Mervyn Johns (Dead of Night) and Gordon Jackson (Whisky Galore! / The Quatermass Experiment) in a film that cleverly entwines the dynamics of a thriller with biting social commentary and a multi-layered plot structure that contrasts the parallels of the British class system.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025133700 +0000" stop="20251025150400 +0000" channel="GB32000024G"><title>DAYBREAK</title><desc>Eddie is a man with a secret - his second job is that of public hangman.

29 septembre 2025 a démarré la Fashion Week. L’occasion pour la marque française L’Oréal Paris de créer une nouvelle fois l’évènement avec son défilé « Liberté, égalité, sororité » organisé cette année sur le parvis de l&apos;Hôtel de Ville de Paris. Ce défilé très attendu réinvente l&apos;iconique devise nationale française « Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité » en y apportant une touche féminine et féministe pour célébrer l&apos;émancipation, la confiance en soi et la sororité. Loin des standards habituels, le défilé met en lumière la beauté sous toutes ses formes et célèbre l&apos;émancipation féminine à travers le maquillage et la coiffure. Pour porter ces valeurs, des icônes fidèles ont répondu présentes : Eva Longoria et Andie MacDowell vont défiler aux côtés de top modèles tels que Cindy Bruna ou encore Helen Mirren. Et cette année, celle qui fera l’évènement, c’est Charlotte Cardin qui montera sur le podium et offrira au public un concert inédit.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025095500 +0000" stop="20251025104000 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>66 minutes : grand format</title><desc>Reportages, portraits, enquêtes, 66 Minutes : grand format explore l&apos;actualité avec un reportage sur un fait divers, un phénomène de société ou un événement de l&apos;actualité internationale.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025104000 +0000" stop="20251025104500 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>66 minutes</title><desc>Reportages, portraits, enquêtes, 66 Minutes explore l&apos;actualité de la semaine avec 3 ou 4 reportages sur des faits divers, des phénomènes de société ou des événements de l&apos;actualité internationale.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025104500 +0000" stop="20251025113000 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>Le 12.45</title><desc>Retrouvez toute l&apos;actualité de la mi-journée.</desc></programme><programme start="20251025113000 +0000" stop="20251025123500 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>Cauchemar en cuisine</title><desc>Cette semaine, Philippe Etchebest se rend dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, à Sénas, où Mélanie et Mylène, des jumelles de 28 ans, ont fait appel à lui pour sauver le restaurant qu&apos;elles gèrent avec leur grande soeur Séverine.

Not only for a brush-up but to find out what Jestro is after in its hallowed halls. As they Knights battle Jestro – in a somewhat haphazard and lazy way – they discuss the fact that Jestro never wins and that they&apos;re always getting over on him. Despite defeating the jerky Jester and his evil Book, Merlok 2.0 discovers that something about the attack on the village is tied to the Knights&apos; Academy. It looks like that&apos;s where they&apos;ll strike next. It wouldn&apos;t hurt for the Knights to go “back to school” to watch for Jestro and for some refresher training. Merlok is sure Jestro wants something at the Academy, but he doesn&apos;t know what it is. The Knights are very much “fish out of water” at the academy, even with the “cool kids” – Robin and Ava – showing them around. The next generation of Knights is being taught to integrate the NEXO-Magic of Merlok into their fighting techniques and t</desc></programme><programme start="20251025175500 +0000" stop="20251025181800 +0000" channel="USBA2300001S8"><title>The CHI Jackers</title><desc>The Wolves have become strong because of the stolen CHI.

At the local snow lodge&apos;s Snowboard Meet, ace snowboarder Mia, trying to raise money for a new Heartlake City animal shelter, enters the fiercest race of all – the Boardercross. Then, while practicing, she has an accident and hurts her ankle. She insists it&apos;s no big deal, but once she heals and tries to resume practice, the usually fearless Mia finds she&apos;s now terrified of snowboarding! With the help of her Friends, she tries hard to overcome her fear, but her nightmarish visions of snowboard monsters and jeering snowmen have her shaking in her bed. She backs out of the race, disappointing her Friends and herself.
