Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games.

The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row.

Nachdem ihr Vater (Keith Carradine) die gegen die evangelistischen Lehren rebellierende Emily (Emma Bell, Cynthia Nixon) schon früh aus der Schule nahm, verbrachte sie fortan die Zeit zusammen mit ihrem Bruder Austin und ihrer Schwester Vinnie in ihrem Elternhaus, das sie selten verließ. Sie hatte nur wenige Kontakte außerhalb der Familie und verbrachte Nacht um Nacht mit dem Verfassen von Gedichten. - &apos;A Quiet Passion&apos; beleuchtet das Leben und die Werke der herausragenden Poetin, die mit einem außerordentlichen Intellekt, aber einer labilen Psyche ausgestattet war, in ihrer großen Schaffensphase.</desc></programme><programme start="20251009100000 +0000" stop="20251009114500 +0000" channel="ATBA3300021BW"><title>Der Liebhaber</title><desc>5 Jahre nach dem Tod ihres Sohnes will Tess leben, doch die Besessenheit eines Soldaten stürzt sie ins Chaos.</desc></programme><programme start="20251009114500 +0000" stop="20251009132500 +0000" channel="ATBA3300021BW"><title>Liebe kochen</title><desc>Zwischen einem Teilnehmer einer Reality-TV-Kochshow und dem gutaussehenden Gründer einer Fast-Food-Kette sprüht der Funke</desc></programme><programme start="20251009132500 +0000" stop="20251009150500 +0000" channel="ATBA3300021BW"><title>Essen, trinken und heiraten</title><desc>Billie und Charlie legen ihre Differenzen beiseite, um sicherzustellen, dass Max und Jess heiraten und sich ineinander verlieben.</desc></programme><programme start="20251009150500 +0000" stop="20251009165000 +0000" channel="ATBA3300021BW"><title>Alex &amp; Eve</title><desc>Alex ist ein smarter griechisch-orthodoxer Lehrer und notorischer Junggeselle.

Having travelled the world as a teacher of English as a foreign language, Diane has gone back to her roots to the town where she was raised where she now runs an Air BnB. Diane is an inveterate collector and her home is stuffed with treasures that include a painting from her father, some Asian vases, jewellery, ceramics and glassware. There&apos;s no shortage of things for Jules and appraiser Paul to rummage through, but will there be any valuables to be found? Diane would like to find the money to splash out on a dancing holiday in Spain and make her contribution to her son&apos;s upcoming wedding.
