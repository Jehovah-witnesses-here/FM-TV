At the local snow lodge&apos;s Snowboard Meet, ace snowboarder Mia, trying to raise money for a new Heartlake City animal shelter, enters the fiercest race of all – the Boardercross. Then, while practicing, she has an accident and hurts her ankle. She insists it&apos;s no big deal, but once she heals and tries to resume practice, the usually fearless Mia finds she&apos;s now terrified of snowboarding! With the help of her Friends, she tries hard to overcome her fear, but her nightmarish visions of snowboard monsters and jeering snowmen have her shaking in her bed.

Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV…maybe they can “mod” that for their own, “knightly” use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling…in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE! This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters. Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he&apos;s safe from the Knights&apos; reach. We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book. In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters. Lance thinks he should be the leader because he&apos;s a snot. “</desc></programme><programme start="20251007112100 +0000" stop="20251007114400 +0000" channel="USBA2300001S8"><title>The Warrior Within</title><desc>Cragger tricks Laval into withholding CHI from the Crocodile tribe.
