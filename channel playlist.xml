But Merlok smells a trap…is he right? In a dark, destroyed part of the kingdom, Jestro arrives at the ruins of a HUGE castle. The Book of Monsters knows this place: the great evil wizard Monstrux lived here. The Book sniffs out some powerful magic in the ruins: “The Book of Destruction.” With this, The Book tells Jestro they can destroy the NEXO-Knights and then attack the King&apos;s Castle and cause massive destruction. Jestro creates destructive monsters and sends them all over the realm, so the Knights must separate and fight single combats all over the place. The Knights lose these battles (lesson: they have to work as a team!) And, just when the Knights are scattered across the Kingdom, Jestro attacks the King&apos;s Castle! It looks like all is lost. When Aaron, who has escaped, returns to see Jestro&apos;s attack, he realizes he must gather his fellow Knights.

One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent&apos;s guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc></programme><programme start="20251019020000 +0000" stop="20251019023000 +0000" channel="BUZZR.us2"><title>Card Sharks</title><desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash.
