When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur.
