One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent&apos;s guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one.

Eventually finding refuge in a local tavern, he is immediately attracted to the sordid glamour of the drinking classes and the gritty world that they inhabit. He also finds himself becoming infatuated with the tavern&apos;s landlady, which will inadvertently lead to him being drawn into a plot to kill her abusive husband. Directed by Robert Hamer (Kind Hearts and Coronets, School For Scoundrels), Pink String and Sealing Wax stars Googie Withers (The Lady Vanishes), Mervyn Johns (Dead of Night) and Gordon Jackson (Whisky Galore! / The Quatermass Experiment) in a film that cleverly entwines the dynamics of a thriller with biting social commentary and a multi-layered plot structure that contrasts the parallels of the British class system.</desc></programme><programme start="20251012104300 +0000" stop="20251012121000 +0000" channel="GB32000024G"><title>DAYBREAK</title><desc>Eddie is a man with a secret - his second job is that of public hangman.

Ronflements, insomnies, réveils décalés ou lit trop petit… pour certains couples, le vrai luxe, ce n’est plus de dormir côte à côte, mais de dormir chacun dans sa chambre ! Longtemps tabou, ce choix s’assume de plus en plus. En France, près d’un couple sur dix a décidé de se séparer la nuit, sans se séparer pour autant. Loin du cliché du couple en crise, ces nouveaux adeptes du “chacun son lit” revendiquent une autre façon de s’aimer : plus reposée, plus complice et parfois… plus pimentée ! Car pour eux, la distance fait naître le désir. Et c’est bien connu, les retrouvailles n’en sont que meilleures. Nous avons suivi plusieurs couples qui ont fait ce pari audacieux. Certains dorment à part depuis des années, d’autres ont franchi le pas récemment pour sauver leur sommeil… et leur relation.

Mais attention, ils devront éviter la redoutable banqueroute et les autres pièges qu’elle réserve. Chaque jour, trois candidats s&apos;affrontent à travers cinq manches, durant lesquelles ils doivent résoudre une énigme en découvrant un mot ou des expressions. Trouver une consonne leur rapporte de l&apos;argent, tandis que les voyelles sont payantes. À la fin de la cinquième manche, celui ayant amassé le plus d&apos;argent accède à la finale, ce qui lui offre le droit de revenir le lendemain. Lors de la finale, il peut remporter jusqu&apos;à 20 000 euros ou un voyage, à condition de résoudre une ultime énigme en seulement 10 secondes !</desc></programme><programme start="20251014163500 +0000" stop="20251014174000 +0000" channel="M6.fr"><title>La meilleure cuisine régionale, c&apos;est chez moi !</title><desc>De la Corse à l’Alsace, de l’Auvergne à la Provence, des dizaines de restaurateurs bien décidés à faire briller leur région vont accueillir chez eux les chefs Norbert Tarayre et Yoann Conte !
