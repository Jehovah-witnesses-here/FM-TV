When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur. The show airs weekday afternoons throughout the year on SEC Network.</desc></programme><programme start="20251003230000 +0000" stop="20251004010000 +0000" channel="I611.89535.schedulesdirect.org"><title>Women&apos;s College Volleyball [NEW]</title><desc>From Gillom Athletics Performance Center in Oxford, Miss.</desc></programme><programme start="20251004010000 +0000" stop="20251004020000 +0000" channel="I611.89535.schedulesdirect.org"><title>SEC Now [NEW]</title><desc>The flagship news and information program of the SEC Network -- ESPN&apos;s 24/7 multiplatform sports network devoted to the Southeastern Conference -- is &quot;SEC Now,&quot; broadcast weekdays from the network&apos;s studios in Charlotte, N.C.
